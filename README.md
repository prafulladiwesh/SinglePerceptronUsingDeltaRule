## Introduction:
This implementation is part of an academic programming assignment during Machine Learning Lecture of Perceptron Models.

## Implementation:
The task is to write a python program to implement a single perceptron using delta rule with 0/1 activation function. The input file reads first column value as class where classes can be class A (y=1) and class B (y=0).

## Input data:
Input data is expected to be a .tsv (tabular separated value) file which will be provided through terminal while running the program

## Output:
Expected output is a .tsv file where the 2 rows contains errors with constant and annealing learning rate respectively. It will be created in the same working directory.

## How to Run the program?
Using the following command:

    python3 perceptron.py --data somedata.tsv --output someerror.tsv
